To receive board information I expect:

board{

	hand1{
		card,card,card
	}
	hand2{
		card,card,card
	}
	aura1{
		card,card,card
	}
	aura2{
		card,card,card
	}
	creature1{
		card,card,card
	}
	creature2{
		card,card,card
	}
	health1:
	health2:
	res1:
	res2:
	deck1:
	deck2:
	manaPool1{
		mana,mana,mana
	}
	manaPool2{
		mana,mana,mana
	}
	
	
}


card looks like:
card{
	IID:
	TID:
	cost:
	health:
	attack:
	text:
	name:
	image:
	type:
	state:
}

IID is the Individual ID of a card. Each card in a game has a unique one.
They allow animating to a card. For example, if the host tells me that 
IID 5 attacks IID 6, I can find both and draw that occurring.

TID is the Type ID of a card. It specifies the "type" of a card. This tells me
where to find the default cost, stats, name, text, and image for it. This is unique
for each card type, and we will need to bwild and a shared registry of them.

state represents one of canattack, canplay, etc (we can define more).
I will border them based on their state (ie canattack might be a light blue border or smth).

The stat slots and TID slot are always optional. If I have seen an IID before and do not
recieve new information, I will assume the information from the last time I saw that IID.
If I get a TID for a card whose IID is new to me, I will assume the default info for it.

So I only need stats information when it is different from the TID default / different
from last time I saw the card.


mana looks like:
1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5 
where
1 represents "air" 
and 2 represents "water" 
and 3 represents "fire" 
and 4 represents "earth" 
and 5 represents "balance"

health, res, and deck look like:
an integer, representing their value.
