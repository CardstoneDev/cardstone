When I want to inform the host of user input, I will send it in the following form:

	userevent{

		name:
		
		IID1:
		
		IID2:

	}

		Event name specifies one of several event types, ie "activated", "played", "attacked".

		IID1 specifies the first card. In the case of certain events, like "endturn", there
		may be no IID1.

		IID2 specifies the second card. In the case of certain events, like "activated", there
		may be no IID2.

When I send an event, I will expect a response of the form:

	userresponse{

		status:

	}

		status will take the form of either 0 or 1, where 0 means the 
		action was denied and 1 means it was allowed.

When the host needs user input, it may send a message of the form:

	inputrequest{
	
		name:
		
		options{
			option,option
		}
		
		cards{
			card,card,card
		}
	
	}
	
		name will represent one of several possible names for the event, such as
		"choosefrom" or "selecttarget"
		
		options will represent specific information about the event. This
		may represent valid zones for targeting in the event of a target request,
		etc.
		
		cards will represent the affected cards. This may represent cards
		to choose from in the event of choosing from among several options,
		etc.
