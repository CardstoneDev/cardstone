# Cardstone: The Shattering
RELOADED
Cardstone is a collectible card game inspired by games such as Hearthstone and Magic: The Gathering. It was created by Josh Pattiz, Raghu Nimmagadda, Ryan Hecht, and Will Riley as their term project for Brown University's CSCI 0320: Introduction to Software Engineering in Spring 2017.

The game's backend is powered by a Spark/Jetty webserver, with frontend user interface being primarily created with FTL, save for the game screen itself, which was lovingly crafted with CSS and ES6 galore (check out https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C_V4HzUXsAE3RmM.jpg for a preview of the game board). The frontend and backend communicate through WebSockets, powered by the API in Spark.

The website has features such as lobbies, spectating, interactive deck building, replays of past games, and more. We could explain intimately how they all work in this README, but we have a lovely tutorial on the site that can walk you through all the basics!
